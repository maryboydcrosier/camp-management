# camp-management
This repository is focused on code to streamline summer camp management and organization of data. 
As a 7 year veteran of a summer camp in North Carolina, I have seen a need for automation in activity and schedule management, data organization, and seemless integration of various systems, from databases for parents to data collected by the nurses.
I plan to use this platform to experiment with different possible systems to do just that - simplify aspects of the complexity of camp management.
